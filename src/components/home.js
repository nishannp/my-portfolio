        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome! My name is Nishan Nepali, and I'm a passionate and driven individual navigating the dynamic landscape of adolescence. At the age of 17, I find myself on the brink of adulthood, eagerly embracing the opportunities and challenges that come my way.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in the scenic district of Surkhet, Nepal, I am fortunate to call this breathtaking region my home. Surrounded by lush greenery, majestic mountains, and vibrant culture, I draw constant inspiration from the beauty of my surroundings.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about three main interests: photography, cycling, and coding. These pursuits serve as the cornerstone of my identity, allowing me to express myself creatively, stay active, and engage with the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
        <p>Photography, in particular, holds a special place in my heart. Through the lens of my camera, I strive to capture the essence of life's fleeting moments – from the subtle beauty of nature to the raw emotions of human experience. Each photograph is a testament to my curiosity and appreciation for the world around me.</p>
        <p>When I'm not behind the camera, you'll often find me exploring the great outdoors on my trusty bicycle. Cycling has been a lifelong passion of mine, offering me a sense of freedom, adventure, and connection with nature. Whether I'm navigating winding mountain trails or cruising through bustling city streets, I cherish every moment spent on two wheels.</p>
        <p>In addition to my love for photography and cycling, I am equally enamored with the world of coding. As a self-taught programmer, I am constantly honing my skills and exploring new technologies. From building websites to developing mobile apps, coding allows me to transform my ideas into reality and make a positive impact in the digital realm.</p>
        <p>Beyond my personal interests, I am deeply committed to academic excellence and lifelong learning. As a dedicated student, I approach each day with a thirst for knowledge and a desire to expand my horizons. Whether I'm studying mathematics, literature, or computer science, I strive to challenge myself and push the boundaries of my intellect.</p>
        <p>Looking towards the future, my aspirations are limitless. I envision a world where creativity, innovation, and compassion reign supreme – a world where individuals are empowered to pursue their passions and make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, I am a young individual with a zest for life and a hunger for adventure. Through my photography, cycling, coding, and academic pursuits, I seek to leave a lasting impact on the world around me. Join me on this journey of discovery, exploration, and personal growth as we embark on the exciting path that lies ahead.</p>
